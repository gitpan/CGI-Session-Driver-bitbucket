CGI::Session::Driver::bitbucket allows module users to test an application which uses CGI::Session but without having to set up any sort of data store at all.  Basically it's so you can test it stateless for syntax etc. without a datastore and without having to comment out all the session code.

This driver is the same as CGI::Session::BitBucket from CGI::Session 3.95 but refitted for CGI::Session 4.0

Example:

$session = new CGI::Session("driver:bitbucket", $sid, {});

$session->flush;  # to the bit bucket!
